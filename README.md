# TD GLSL Instancing with Transform Matrices

Translate/Scale/Rotate instances from sampled textures. Also can displace vertices differently per instance.

Thanks to [Tim](https://github.com/timgerritsen) and [Landon](https://github.com/landonth) for their help.

Next step is to incorporate Landon's smoothed normal recalculation from [here](https://github.com/landonth/normals-gpu) and add 3D texturing with different textures per instance.
